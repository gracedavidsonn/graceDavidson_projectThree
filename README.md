# Project 3: Social Justice Festival
By Grace Davidson

## Overview

**Our Choice Festival** is my concept for a festival that supports and raises awareness for the protection of reproductive rights in the United States. This is a pressing issue because <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/abortion-laws-by-state/">the reproductive autonomy of millions of people across thirteen states are not protected.</a> This not only violates their rights but it puts them at risk of pregnancy complications that can be fatal without an abortion. With the 2024 election results, it’s even more urgent that we come together to stand up and fight for our choice.

**Our Choice Festival** is a place for people of all ages, genders, ethnicities, and sexual orientations to share their passion for defending reproductive rights. OCF will take place at Grant Park in Chicago next summer on June 20 through June 22. I chose Chicago as the location for my festival because Illinois is a state with abortion protections in place but it is surrounded by states with abortion bans in place. Also, as a famous festival location, the goal in choosing Grant Park is to attract people from these nearby states where abortion is banned.
